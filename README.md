# Surfs_Up
Data Bootcamp work for SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask

# Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the weather in Hawaii over the year in order to determine if it is a good idea to open up a surf and ice cream shop on Oahu.

## Results
- The average temperature on Oahu in December is only 3 degrees colder than it is in June. 
- The minimum temperature in December got down to 56 degrees, however that is an outlier compared to the rest of the data.
- The temperature never got above 90 degrees on Oahu any day.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, the temperature on Oahu stays mild in both Winter and Summer, so it may not get hot enough for someone to consistently crave ice cream, being that the temperature is usually around 70-75 degrees. However, this is a great temperature for surfing. Two additional queries I would run on this data to give a better analysis would be adding one to show the precipitation data throughout the year as well as more analysis on the spring and fall in order to see what is happening in the other months of the year.
